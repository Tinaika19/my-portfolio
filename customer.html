                    In this project, I utilized customer analytics skills to perform segmentation and profiling on a
                    consumer credit card portfolio dataset. The dataset contained detailed demographic and behavioral
                    information, including age, gender, marital status, income category, card type, balance, credit
                    limit, spending habits, and a Naive Bayes classifier attrition flag for predicting potential
                    customer attrition.

                    The goal was to enhance business value propositions by identifying customer groups with similar
                    characteristics, enabling more effective communication and engagement strategies. Using SAS Miner, I
                    employed techniques such as variable transformation, filtering, clustering, and segmentation. The
                    analysis revealed a predominance of female customers across segments and identified Segment 5 as the
                    most prominent, constituting 28% of the total customer base. This project demonstrated the
                    effectiveness of data-driven insights in predicting customer behavior and optimizing engagement
                    strategies.

                    We used the filter node to focus on existing customers and found that segments 6, 2, and 4 were
                    significant. Key variables identified were gender and age for segment 6, marital status and gender
                    for segment 2, and age and gender for segment 4. Females were the predominant gender across
                    segments, with married individuals being more common in segment 2. Segment 5 showed that female
                    gender was less influential. Overall, the analysis highlighted females as a dominant demographic
                    among existing customers and emphasized the significance of marital status within segment 2.

                    In the analysis of attrited customers, segment 5 had the highest count with 278 instances, all

                    segments 5 and 1, key variables were gender and age. Existing customers had a higher count compared
                    to attrited customers, and demographic variables showed higher significance among attrited
                    customers.
