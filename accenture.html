                    This AI project was part of the Accenture Women in Technology Bootcamp, an intensive four-day,
                    hands-on program. We collaborated in groups to design a solution for a given problem and presented
                    our work in front of judges. Our project involved creating an interactive app using AI to assist
                    employees with disabilities in accessing information about their workplace's inclusion policies and
                    disability guidelines. This experience provided me with valuable real-world experience, allowing me
                    to work effectively in a team while honing both my technical and soft skills.</p>

                        We developed an interactive app called AccessPoint using AI to help employees with disabilities
                        access information about their workplace's inclusion policies and disability guidelines.
                        Some of its features includes:

                    We aimed to design a user interface that is both simple and intuitive, ensuring that people with
                    disabilities can navigate the app effortlessly. Additionally, we chose a light color scheme to
                    enhance accessibility and avoid bright, overwhelming colors.

                    This is our solution architecture that describes the flow of operation as well as some of the front
                    end and backend technologies used

                    The user can interact with our chatbot to request information about workplace accommodations for
                    disabilities.

                    For example, the user can send a message by interacting with the frontend, where we have used HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, and React.

                    The chatbot will then provide information back to the user.
                    On the backend, we used Node.js and JavaScript to handle these requests.
                    Lastly For storing information, we used a software called Pinecone.

                    Therefore, we have created a seamless and user-friendly experience for our users</p>
