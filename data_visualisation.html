                    This project focuses on generated visualizations and dashboards and comes up with recommendations.
                    Over the years, the pharmaceutical, personal care, and nutritional industries have converged,
                    leading to the emergence of new industry segments: Nutraceuticals, Cosmeceuticals, and
                    Nutricosmetics. However, when examining the demand for these segments in Australia, notable
                    differences become apparent. Consumers have varying preferences and make distinct choices when
                    purchasing these products, making it essential to observe changes in consumer behavior. To promote
                    sales effectively, we need to focus on products that may not be as popular among consumers,
                    specifically Cosmeceuticals, Nutricosmetics, and Nutraceuticals
                </p>

                <p>The overall insights that are gathered from the two analytical dashboards generated in PowerBI and
                    SAP
                    Lumira are that the demand of cosmeceuticals is considerably low compared to Nutricosmetics and
                    Nutraceuticals in New South Wales and Western Australia. Also, social media is the most popular
                    channel
                    among people of various age groups. Therefore, it is highly recommended that companies should have
                    online
                    presence to boost sales</p>

                    living in NSW are ready to purchase nutraceuticals. While there is demand in cosmeceuticals in
                    Queensland.
                    Moreover, majority of the people are confident in the results of nutricosmetics products. Finally,
                    most of the

                    With reference to the above dashboard generated in SAP Lumira, we can observe that age groups less

                    years are confident in the results of nutricosmetics products. While people aged 40- 50 years are
                    confident in
                    cosmeceuticals. Moreover, we can also see that people are ready to send on nutricosmetics products
                    among
                    males and females. On the other hand, social media is quite popular among various age groups.

                        It is crucial for any business to have an online presence, and social media is a popular channel
                        across various age groups for contacting people. Businesses should leverage digital marketing on
                        platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to advertise and attract more customers.
                        Facebook, with over 2.9 billion users, offers many features for selling, such as Facebook Pages,
                        Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Businesses can also create a Facebook Shop section to sell
                        products and display information like prices and offers to persuade consumers to make purchases

                    <p>
                        Focusing on packaging and pricing on products are crucial. A study has shown that
                        more than 50% of customers check the quality of the supplement with the product information and
                        container label. Companies can also use attractive packaging and providing health benefits for
                        each
                        9
                        Cosmeceuticals, Nutricosmetics and Nutraceuticals products. Moreover, Pricing can have a
                        significant
                        impact on the overall success of a product when promoting a product, it is important to pick a
                        price that is
                        available to the target market and meets the companyâ€™s goals. For example, prices of
                        Nutraceuticals
                        products can be substantially moderate to high in New South Wales since people are willing to
                        spend on
                        them.
